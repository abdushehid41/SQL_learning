# 🟦 SQL Fundamentals (The Basics)

This folder contains the foundation of my SQL journey. Before moving to complex joins, I mastered the core syntax required to build, modify, and query databases from scratch.

## 🏗️ 1. Database Construction (DDL)

**Data Definition Language** is how we build the "skeleton" of the database.

- **CREATE**: Building new tables with specific data types.
- **ALTER**: Modifying existing structures without losing data.
- **DROP**: Safely removing tables when they are no longer needed.

## ✍️ 2. Data Management (DML)

**Data Manipulation Language** is how we interact with the "meat" of the database.

- **INSERT**: Adding new records into tables.
- **UPDATE**: Modifying existing information.
- **DELETE**: Removing specific rows while maintaining data integrity.

## 🔍 3. Essential Querying

Mastering the standard flow of a query:

- **SELECT/FROM**: The starting point of every data request.
- **Basic Filtering**: Using `=` and simple logic to find exactly what I need.
