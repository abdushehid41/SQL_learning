# 🟨 Intermediate SQL: Relational Logic & Data Transformation

This folder represents my transition from basic data retrieval to advanced relational database management. The scripts here demonstrate my ability to handle complex data structures and extract meaningful insights.

---

## 1. Advanced Relational Joins 🔗
In these scripts, I move beyond simple tables to connect data across the entire database schema.
* **Inner & Left Joins**: The bread and butter of data analysis.
* **Cross Joins**: Used for generating permutations and complex combinations.
* **Anti-Joins**: Critical for identifying missing data or "orphaned" records (rows in one table with no match in another).
* **Multi-Table Join Logic**: Connecting 3 or more tables while maintaining query performance.



---

## 2. Set Theory & Operators ⚡
Using mathematical set logic to combine different query results.
* **UNION & UNION ALL**: Vertically merging datasets.
* **INTERSECT**: Finding commonalities between two distinct data groups.
* **EXCEPT/MINUS**: Filtering out specific subsets of data from a larger result.

## 3. Data Transformation (Functions) 🛠️
Raw data is rarely perfect. These scripts show how I "clean" and format data for reporting:
* **String Functions**: Using `TRIM`, `SUBSTR`, `CONCAT`, and `REPLACE` to fix messy text.
* **Date & Time**: mastering `DATEDIFF`, `DATEADD`, and timestamp extraction to perform time-series analysis.
* **Filtering Logic**: Using `WHERE` with complex `AND/OR` logic, `LIKE` wildcards, and `IN` lists.

*Next Goal: Moving into Advanced SQL topics like Subqueries, CTEs (Common Table Expressions), and Window Functions.*
