# 📊 SQL Learning Journey

Welcome to my SQL repository! This project tracks my progress from foundational queries to intermediate data manipulation. I've structured my learning into distinct modules to maintain a clean workflow.

## 📂 Project Structure

### 🟦 [Basics](./Basics)

_Foundational concepts for interacting with relational databases._

- **Data Definition Language (DDL)**: Creating, Altering, and Dropping table structures.
- **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**: Inserting, Updating, and Deleting records.
- **Data Retrieval**: Mastering the `SELECT` statement and basic filtering.

### 🟨 [Intermediate](./Intermediate)

_More advanced techniques for complex data analysis._

- **Conditional Logic**: Deep dive into `WHERE` clauses using `LIKE`, `BETWEEN`, and `IN`.
- **Joins & Relationships**: Combining data using `INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `CROSS`, and `ANTI` joins.
- **Set Operations**: Utilizing `UNION`, `EXCEPT`, and `INTERSECT`.
- **Built-in Functions**: Working with **String** manipulation and **Date & Time** functions.

# 📁 Projects

- **[LeetCode SQL 50](./LeetCode_Challenges)** - Solutions to the SQL 50 study plan using **MS SQL Server (T-SQL)**. Organized by category (Select, Joins, etc.).
